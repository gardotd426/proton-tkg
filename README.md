# proton-tkg and wine-tkg-git
Just a way for me to host and back up my Tk-Glitch proton-tkg configs and patches and stuff. 

I also use this repo to post prebuilt releases for both wine-tkg-git and proton-tkg on request. I'm happy to build custom builds for you if you need them. 

I accept payment in the form of frogs (and paypal donations, but in all seriousness I'm happy to create a build for free if you need one, just file an issue)

Also, actually donate to TK-Glitch. He's on Patreon, and he's an absolute treasure.
