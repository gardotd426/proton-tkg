# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Proton-TkG config file

# This is a simplified config file with minimal comments. See ../wine-tkg-git/customization.cfg for more details.
# Some options will be missing from this config file compared to wine-tkg-git as they are enforced.

#### NON-MAKEPKG OPTIONS (Won't affect makepkg builds) ####

# Set to true to get a prompt after the 64-bit part is built, enabling package switching before building the 32-bit side.
# This is a workaround for distros shipping broken devel packages that can't coexist as multilib
_nomakepkg_midbuild_prompt="false"

####


# Set to true if you want to skip the uninstaller at the end of proton-tkg building
_skip_uninstaller="false"

_proton_use_steamhelper="true"

# Set to true to disable proton's steamclient lib substitution. Allows running windows steam client in proton (only affects 4.19+)
